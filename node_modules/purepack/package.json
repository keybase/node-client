  "readme": "purepack\n========\n\nA pure CoffeeScript implemented of Msgpack.\n\nWe've made one addition to the spec.  When reserved byte `0xc4` prefaces\na raw string, the subsequent value is to be interepreted as raw bytes, and\nnot a UTF-8 string.\n\nTo force this behavior on the packing side, feed a Uint8Array to the packer\n(instead of a regular string).  Uint8Arrays will automatically be returned\nfrom unpacking.\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install purepack\n\n## Where To Use it\n\nTested and works with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), so\nit's useful for packing and unpacking structures on the browser-side.  It also works\nserver-side in `node` processes.  In either case, it finds the fastest buffer\nobjects at its disposal to give you the best performance possible.\n\n## API\n\n### purepack.pack(obj,encoding,opts)\n\nPack an object `obj`.\n\n##### encoding\n\nAfter packing, output the result according to the given encoding.  Encodings include\n\n* `buffer` — Output as a `buffer.Buffer` on node, or a `Uint8Array` buffer in a browser\n* `base64` — Output as a standard base64-encoded string (with `+` and `/` outputs at positions 62 and 63)\n* `base64a` — Output as base64-encoding, with `@` and `_` characters rather than\nthe `+` and `/` characters.  Better for URLs.\n* `base64x` — Output as base64-encoding, with `+` and `-` characters rather than\nthe `+` and `/` characters.  Better for filenames.\n* `base32` — [sfs](https://github.com/okws/sfslite)-style base32-encoding\n* `hex` — Standard base16/hex encoding\n* `binary` — Output as a binary string. Beware, UTF-8 problems ahead!\n* `ui8a` — Synonym for `buffer` on the browser, or output to a `Uint8Array` on node.\n\n##### opts\n\nThere are two options currently supported, off by default:\n\n* `floats` — Use floats rather than doubles when encoding.  Useful when saving space\n* `byte_arrays` — Encode Uint8Arrays differently from UTF-8 strings, using the `0xc4`\nprefix described above.\n\n### purepack.unpack(obj,encoding)\n\nUnpack a packed object `obj`, which has been packed and encoded according to the \ngiven `encoding`.  See above for possibilities.  Returns a pair `[err,res]`.  `err`\nwill be `null` if the unpacking succeeded, or will be non-null and a description\nif there was an unpacking error. \n\n## Building\n\n    make setup\n    make\n\n## Testing\n\n    make setup\n    make\n    make test\n\nTesting will run a series of scripts on your machine using `node`.  It also will\nask you to visit a URL with whichever browsers you please to test `purepack` \nuse via `browserify` and with your browser's buffer objects.     ",
